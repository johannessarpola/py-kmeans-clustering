      "original": "The shipping was quite quick but this BB cream is DEFINITELY worth the wait.  It's not heavy, not too light (in color), it's perfect for my skin (I'm medium-fair)  I wear it both with and without foundation over top and my skin looks flawless either way.  I bought the fancy looking BB cream in the fancy gold container (also Korean) and it didn't even come close to the quality of this one.  The other BB cream also irritated my typically not sensitive face.  I definitely recommend this one!!"

      "original": "My children, (4.5 and 2.5) got these for Christmas, one set each.  Shown here is the red and purple set which my daughter received, but they also come in blue & yellow which is what my son has and I believe another color combination.  There are two shapes - 18 squares and 12 triagles in the 30 piece box.  30 pieces is enough to build decent sized shapes, but if you have a builder who enjoys elaborate structures, they may want more pieces.They do indeed go together as described on the box.  They never reject on the edge, if you flip it over the other way, it still connects.  I did find that certain combinates of putting them face to face does reject and the shape has to be flipped over.  The magnets are completely encapsulated in the plastic, not glued in the edges as was the problem with magnet toys which have been recalled - as these strong magnets can be deadly when swallowed.  That is my largest concern with this toy, but I spent some time trying to pry apart the plastic to be sure it was secure and it flexed some but seemed pretty well put together.  Given the CPSC's recalls on other toys using similar magnets, however, I will be keeping a very close eye on these.As for the educational value, they are wonderful - my 4.5 year old daughter was immediately building all sorts of geometric shapes with it, and while my son isn't at that level, he still enjoyed stacking them and pulling them apart.  This toy is a great alternative to the much more expensive magnatiles.Update: 4 years later - these were a big hit for a long time.  They still do play with them sometimes, now at 6 and 8."
